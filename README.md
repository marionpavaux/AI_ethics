# AI Ethics Report  

Evalutation of the Societal Impacts of AI and Ethics and AI module at 'les Mines de Saint-Etienne'. 
The report should focus on one domain/application and present the societal impacts of AI, ethical problems that exist or could exist, and values or principles that may be attacked or supported by the technologies developed in this domain. 
I chose the emotional intelligence as it has applications in many domains such as health, road safety, marketing, etc... and can be a very sensitive technology.  

The report is written in French.
